* took decimal values out of face editor in shifting.
* IMPORTANT: first corner of a path drawn with the path tool
  is now named "fred" instead of "fred00". you will need to
  change all objects that targetted the old path (use the
  entity report dialog for this.)
* removed all visible references to "Quake" in the editor.
* ALSO IMPORTANT: the .FGD file is now called HALFLIFE.FGD,
  so as not to confuse press people. 

----

* fixed clip plane weirdness (duplicate objects)
+ entity report dialog now saves info between sessions,
  and there's an "exact match" checkbox for keyvalue filters.

----

+ "Select by X" and "Infinite select" are now toggles on the
  toolbar.
* Fixed a bug where deleting a key would set its value to
  "0".

----

+ added PATH CORNERS tool. this is not perfect yet (you can't
  selectively hide paths), but it does work. to use it, click
  the path tool icon. to create a new path, hold down SHIFT
  and drag it out. to create a new node, make sure no nodes
  are currently selected. hold down CTRL, click on a node,
  and drag out the new one. the right mouse button menu will 
  pop up by clicking the RMB on a path node. from the menu,
  you can edit the node's properties and the path's properties,
  delete the selected nodes, and add a new node. oops, "add"
  doesn't work yet. you have to use the CTRL method. you can
  also select multiple nodes (even from multiple paths) by
  holding down LMB and dragging a selection box. click off 
  any path nodes to unselect all of them. 

  tying to your map entities: the first node in the path will
  be called NAME00, where NAME is the NAME you gave the path.
  (change the name at any time by selecting "path properties"
  in the RMB context menu.) the subsequent node is, of course, 
  NAME01. the one other neat thing about this tool is that you
  can tell it to automatically loop a path -OR- make a "ping-
  pong" path that traces in one direction and then traces 
  backwards (so you can patrol your dudes.) this setting is
  also available in the "path properties" RMB item. 
  
  if this needs further explanation, please email me and i'll 
  come see you tomorrow morning. also: comments, please!

* changed face painter behavior. right mouse button APPLIES
  all the time now (instead of lifts.)
* problem with vertex selection box fixed.
* problem with tools starting on the wrong grid point fixed.
* 'D' and 'C' now work to zoom the 2D views.


----

* when you clone an object, the result of the clone does not
  share the original object's visgroup
+ added "group ignore" feature ("IG" button on the toolbar.)
  this feature allows you to select members of groups and
  brushmodels without selecting everything in the group. 
  if you have a group/brushmodel selected when you hit IG,
  the selection will be converted to contain all the children.
  this means you can do things like select a group of lights,
  hit IG, and edit their properties. you can also use this
  feature to delete members of groups/brushmodels.

----

* fixed weird display problems when translating stuff.
+ completed visgroup overhaul. you can now create visgroups
  by pressing the HIDE button. all the objects that are
  selected will be placed in this group, which will be named
  "n objects" (n = number of objects you hid.) you can now
  rename groups by clicking on them once in the filter 
  control (just like in explorer.) you can COMBINE groups
  by dragging one onto the other. everything else works
  pretty much the same. objects can be members of only
  one group now. ask me if yoiu have any questions.

----

* fixed the selection box sometimes selecting everything
  in the map.
* Shift+X to activate the clipper wasn't working. fixed.

----

* Shift+Q (to deselect objects) wasn't working properlike.
  fixed.

+ Added manual translation dialog box. Select objects, then
  press Ctrl+M or use Tools|Transform to activate it. krad.
+ Selecting stuff and moving/rotating/shearing/scaling it
  will now display said stuff -while dragging the mouse-.
  This makes it much easier to line stuff up. 


----

* click-moving a vertex without CTRL held down deselects
  other vertices first (didn't before)
* the ALT key will now disable snap to grid when you 
  start a selection/creation box (hold it down before
  you click the left button - didn't before)
* the entity creation tool now snaps to grid (don't know
  why it didn't before)
* CTRL+E now centers on selected vertex/edge handles
* fixed texture browser filter wackiness
