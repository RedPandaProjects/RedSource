// This interface is for voice codecs to implement.

// Codecs are guaranteed to be called with the exact output from Compress into Decompress (ie:
// data won't be stuck together and sent to Decompress).

// Decompress is not guaranteed to be called in any specific order relative to Compress, but 
// Codecs maintain state between calls, so it is best to call Compress with consecutive voice data
// and decompress likewise. If you call it out of order, it will sound wierd. 

// In the same vein, calling Decompress twice with the same data is a bad idea since the state will be
// expecting the next block of data, not the same block.
