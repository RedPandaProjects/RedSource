Taoism oriented farmer
</author>
<body>There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. &spam1;
 One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, &spam1;
 his neighbors came to visit. "Such bad luck," they said sympathetically. "May be,"
  the farmer replied. The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it
  three other wild horses. "How wonderful," the neighbors exclaimed. "May be,"
  replied the old man. The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed
   horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their
   sympathy on his misfortune. &spam2; "May be," answered the farmer. The day after, military
   officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the
   son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer
   on how well things had turned out. "May be," said the farmer. &spam2;

		A martial arts student approached his teacher with a question. "I'd like to
		improve my knowledge of the martial arts. &spam2; In addition to learning from you, I'd like
		to study with another teacher in order to learn another style. What do you think of
		this idea?" &spam1;

		"The hunter who chases two rabbits," answered the master, "catches neither one." &spam2;

<title>Prosperity</title>
<author>Zen master</author>
<body>


A rich man asked a Zen master to write something down that could encourage the prosperity of his family
for years to come. It would be something that the family could cherish for generations. On a large piece
of paper, the master wrote, "Father dies, son dies, grandson dies." &spam2;

		The rich man became angry when he saw the master's work. "I asked you to write something down that could
		bring happiness and prosperity to my family. Why do you give me something depressing like this?"
		&spam1; &spam2;

"If your son should die before you," the master answered, "this would bring unbearable grief to your
family. If your grandson should die before your son, this also would bring great sorrow. If your
family, generation after generation, disappears in the order I have described, it will be the natural
course of life. This is true happiness and prosperity." &product;
