DATATYPE.C SAMPLE
-----------------

This sample demonstrates one possible approach of handling datatypes 
in C SAX parsing. It uses simple ANSI C sscanf for data conversion,
in the real world you're likely to use some more sophisticated 
approach, atleast using snscanf is recommended.

Here is the books DTD:

<!ELEMENT books (book*)>
<!ELEMENT book (author,title,genre,price,publish_date,description)>
<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT genre (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT price (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT publish_date (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST book id ID #REQUIRED>

datatype.c uses standard offsetof macro for "storing" the current
field pointer into book->fld member. In the EndElement event
it's quite easy to determine whether this is offset of string
member which doesn't need conversion or offset of some other 
datatype that needs conversion.

You might also want to normalize string content in string members,
see XMLNormalizeBuf function in the documentation.

WIN32

    VC6 users can build sample by running build.bat.
    Executable will be build into WIN32\BIN directory by default.

UNIX

    make
    make install
