WINURL.C SAMPLE
---------------

This sample demonstrates parsing url using windows COM (urlmon.dll)
as an inputsource for Parsifal.

Inputsource handling is just tiny part of this sample so winurl.c
also demonstrates many basic Parsifal features.

VC6 users can build sample by running build.bat.
Executable will be build into WIN32\BIN directory by default.
