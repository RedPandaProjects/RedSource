<div class="codebox"><b>30.1.2005 - Validation support</b></div>
<br>

<p>
A sort of milestone. Still needs some tweaking and hard testing. Next stop is RelaxNG module?!
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>11.8.2004 - Optimizations and portability improvements</b></div>
<br>

<p>
New release introduces several optimizations (see ChangeLog). Portability has also been improved by making
some changes mostly in xmlcfg.h. Infact PalmOS port should be on its way - I've been in touch with
a guy who's working on this. More about this soon.
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>5.6.2004 - It should be mentioned...</b></div>
<br>

<p>
that although parsifal doesn't yet pass the oasis xml testsuite with 100 % conformance, the most of remaining/failing about 50 of
1811 tests aren't critical for using XML 1.0 features - you can use them all! Also note that there are a few tests that fail
because of namespace support or because the test parser used libiconv and thus reports PASS with japanese encodings etc.
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>1.6.2004 - Towards full XML conformance</b></div>
<br>

<p>
New release 0.8.0 adds support for DTD processing; declaration handlers, default attribute processing
and parameter entities etc. Parser stays quite lightweight despite of all these new features!
</p>

<br>
<div class="codebox"><b>9.3.2004 - Optimization thoughts</b></div>
<br>

<p>
I ran Parsifal 0.7.4 on MSVC++ profiler with test.rdf (11 MB attribute oriented document) some time ago. Function timing results are <a href="profilerrun1.txt">here</a>.
Ignore modules <code>profiler.obj</code> and <code>bench.obj</code> when checking the results.
</p>
<p>
Inlining <code>ReadCh</code> (with <code>__inline</code>) improves the performance most but as there's total 24 occurrences
of ReadCh calls, this makes executable about 4 KB bigger! Making separate version of inlined ReadCh for critical points could be
an option in this case. Besides inlining ReadCh making new version of XMLStringbuf_Append inside <code>parsifal.c</code> and _forceinline'ing it improves
total performance from about 0.88 sec to 0.72 sec. (DLL executable size grows from 80KB to 88KB). I didn't yet make any calling convention tests or changes - don't know if they'll
be worth all the #ifdefs and all that hassle.
</p>
<p>
Some optimizations via conditional compilation will be available in the next release.
