BUILDING
========

On WIN32: 

    Open VC6 workspace file win32\vc6\parsifal.dsw and Build All (note that 
    win32\bin contains dll so if you aren't making any changes to source etc. 
    building isn't necessary)
    
    Each sample directory contains build.bat files that build sample exe's and
    put them into win32\bin directory.


On Linux/Unix:
    
    tar xzf libparsifal-0.X.X.tar.gz
    cd libparsifal-0.X.X
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    
    (installs shared library in to /usr/lib and include files to 
    /usr/include/libparsifal by default so you must have su permissions
    for that)
    
    Each sample directory contains Makefile that build sample exe's and 
    installs them to /usr/local/bin by default, build samples 
    by executing:
    
    make
    make install (optional, you can place executables in to directory of 
        your choice of course)

    Samples aren't build when installing shared library. Library must be build and installed
    before making sample files of course.
    

Compiling options: See doc/index.html and MANUAL/BUILDING for more info
