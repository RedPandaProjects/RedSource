TODO for parsifal
-----------------

* Memory allocation could be "heaps better", string interning, smart heap to
  avoid memory fragmentation etc...
* More profiler runs and optimizations...
* Maybe internal widechar support (wchar_t) by conditional compilation? maybe not.
* There's lot of room for improvement in optimization department.

FOR VALIDATION
--------------

* Validation of advanced attribute types: DONE (EnumeratedType and NotationType)
  (still no ID att handling - no. uniqueness checks etc. and no testing for NOTATIONS -
  wrong side of the 80/20 perhaps?)
  [56] TokenizedType ::= 'ID' | 'IDREF' | 'IDREFS' | 'ENTITY' | 'ENTITIES'| 'NMTOKEN' | 'NMTOKENS'
  [57] EnumeratedType ::= NotationType | Enumeration
  [58] NotationType ::= 'NOTATION' S '(' S? Name (S? '|' S? Name)* S? ')'
  [59] Enumeration ::= '(' S? Nmtoken (S? '|' S? Nmtoken)* S? ')'
* Checking of non-deterministic content models
* Testing/better handling of duplicate attribute declarations (for bsearch)
* Feature to allow validation errors to be reported in WarningHandler (maybe implement
  optionally compiled and separate more complete validation module) DONE
* DTD caching (already designed)
