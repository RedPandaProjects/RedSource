This directory contains Dev-C++ project for building
static parsifal library.

Dev-Cpp IDE: http://www.bloodshed.net (huh?)
MinGW info:  http://www.mingw.org


files:

libparsifal.a     pre-compiled library for mingw projects
libparsifal.dev   dev-cpp workspace
Makefile.win      makefile for mingw. contains some hard-coded paths but
                  should be trivial to change to any mingw environment
