// CLASS:    MTypeId

// *****************************************************************************
//
// CLASS DESCRIPTION (MTypeId)
//
// In Maya, both intrinsic and user-defined Maya Objects are registered and
// recognized by their type identifier or type id.  The basis of the type id
// system is a tag which is used at run-time to determine how to create and
// destroy Maya Objects, and how they are to be input/output from/to files.
// These tag-based identifiers are implemented by the class MTypeId.
// 
// Use the MTypeId class to create, copy and query Maya Object type
// identifiers.
// 
// It is very important to note that these ids are written into the Maya
// binary file format.  So, once an id is assigned to a node or data type it
// can {\em never} be changed while any existing Maya file contains an
// instance of that node or data type.  If a change is made, such files will
// become unreadable.
// 
// Thus, even though we provide a range of reserved ids that you can use for
// internal plug-ins, Autodesk highly recommends that you obtain a
// globally unique id range (see below) and use ids from this range for all
// your plug-ins, even internal ones.  This can prevent significant headaches
// later if the plans for your plug-ins change.
// 
// There are 2 forms of the constructor for this class that can be used
// depending on whether the plug-in id is internal or globally unique.
// 
// For plug-ins that will forever be internal to your site use the constructor
// that takes a single unsigned int parameter.  The numeric range 0 - 0x7ffff
// (524288 ids) has been reserved for such plug-ins.
// 
// The example plug-ins provided by Autodesk in the plug-in development
// kit will use ids in the range 0x80000 - 0xfffff (524288 ids).  If you
// customize one of these example plug-ins, you should change the id to avoid
// future conflicts.
// 
// Plug-ins that are intended to be shared between sites will need to have a
// globally unique id.  The Autodesk Support department will provide
// such id's in blocks of 256.  You will be assigned one or more 24-bit
// prefixes.  Once this has been obtained, used the MTypeId constructor that
// takes 2 unsigned int parameters.  The prefix goes in the first parameter,
// and you are responsible for managing the allocation of the 256 ids that
// go into the second parameter.
