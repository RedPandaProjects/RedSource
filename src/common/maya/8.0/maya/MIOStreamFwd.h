	The MIOStreamFwd.h header file was created to centralize the
	including of the iosfwd header.  You can define REQUIRE_IOSTREAM
	to allow "iostream" to be included rather than "iostream.h".
	iosfwd is a much smaller header than iostream, so speeds compile
	times for cases where you only need to predeclare these
	types. This option is provided as a convenience for external
	developers.
