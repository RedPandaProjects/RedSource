NSVALID.C SAMPLE
----------------

This sample demonstrates filtered validation, external DTD loading 
by using XMLParser_SetExternalSubset function and also basic 
base directory handling for DTDs and external entities.

Nsvalid makes possible to selectively validate elements that are
in namespace specified by URI parameter. Example usage:
nsvalid document.xml /URI:mynamespace

so for example the following document will be valid:

<!DOCTYPE doc [
<!ELEMENT doc (#PCDATA)>
]>
<doc xmlns="mynamespace" xmlns:x="anotherns" x:att="val">
  <x:node/>
</doc>

You can also specify external DTD to be loaded by using
/DTD parameter. This can be useful when the document itself
doesn't contain reference to DTD or you want to override
some declarations. See XMLParser_SetExternalSubset in
the documentation.

/URI and /DTD parameters for nsvalid are both optional.
Without them nsvalid works as simple validator.
