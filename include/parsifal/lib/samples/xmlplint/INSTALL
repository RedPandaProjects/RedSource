LINUX
=====
    
    Install libcurl. Check that your
    curl-config --libs
    gives same libraries as in CURL_LIBS section in xmlplint Makefile 
    (modify if needed)
    
    make
    make install

Visual Studio
=============

1)  download Libcurl curl-7.14.0 (or similar)
    run 2 targets in lib dir:

    command line:
    nmake /f makefile.vc6 CFG=release
    builds static library \release\libcurl.lib which is linked with 
    /MD (Multithreaded DLL)

    command line:
    nmake /f makefile.vc6 CFG=debug
    builds static library \debug\libcurld.lib which is linked with 
    /MDd (Debug Multithreaded DLL)

    put *.h files into Visual Studio\include\curl directory (md curl)
    put *.lib files into Visual Studio\lib directory

2)  Download libiconv win binaries (libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip or similar)
    
    put iconv.h file into Visual Studio\include directory
    put *.lib files into Visual Studio\lib directory
    
3)  Build parsifal library target: "parsifal - Win32 Release ICONV using MultiTh RTL DLL".
    It is essential that all components use same kind of runtime library (in this
    case Multithreaded DLL)

4)  Build xmlplint

MinGW
=====

see Visual Studio section 1 (download libcurl etc.). Build *.m32 libcurl target
and modify Makefile where needed.
