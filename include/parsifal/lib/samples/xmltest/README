XMLCONF TESTSUITE PARSER
========================

Needed components (in this directory):
* download test suite from http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/ (current version 20031210)
  extract all contents of subdirectory XMLCONF into THIS directory - XMLCONF.XML 
  should be in this dir and tests in their respective directories called IBM, SUN etc.
* XMLTEST executable
* CANONXML executable for output tests
* PARSIFAL library should be in search path of course

Usage: 
  XMLTEST XMLCONF.XML RESULTS.HTML
Or:
  Run debug/release version of PARSIFAL.DLL and XMLTEST.EXE in VC++ IDE
  (just load dsw project file and click run). Running debug version gives you 
  chance to monitor memory leaks etc.

File XMLCONF.XML can be any file in XMLCONF format (see TESTCASES.DTD for
description of testsuite format).
