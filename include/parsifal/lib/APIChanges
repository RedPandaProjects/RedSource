Parsifal API changes
====================

0.9.1 -> 0.9.2

Added XMLParser_GetContextBytes function which can be used
to retrieve current context buffer + it returns current
column position in bytes. XMLParser_GetCurrentBuffer returned
column bytes previously - now it returns column position in
characters.


0.8.2 -> 0.8.3

Added XMLParser_GetVersionString function


0.7.3 -> 0.7.4

No significant changes. Only encoding parameter for XMLParser_Parse
works differently. Input source callback can specify new return 
value BIS_ERR_INPUT. See documentation.


0.7.1 -> 0.7.2

flag
#define XMLFLAG_CONVERT_EOL 0x40
isn't currently working (although present in parsifal.h)
Parser does the conversion even when you set this flag to false.
Converting all CRLFs and CRs to LFs simplifies the parser and
is something that all conformant parsers do. CRs must
be handled in application level.

new location functions:
int XMLAPI XMLParser_GetCurrentLine(LPXMLPARSER parser);
int XMLAPI XMLParser_GetCurrentColumn(LPXMLPARSER parser);
+
ErrorColumn member for LPXMLPARSER struct

See documention for more details about these.


0.6.8 -> 0.7.0

API has changed considerably but is now consistent - 
types and stuff are better thought over and WON'T
CHANGE in the upcoming versions.

Note: These changes might seem more annoying than
they actually are, they're mostly simple search and
replace type changes.


- LPXMLVECTOR and attributes cannot be enumerated with void* ++ anymore 
  (there isn't NULL item at the end of vector). You must use 
  XMLVector_Get(atts, index) format.

- type RUNTIMEATT and type RUNTIMETAG have now XML prefix i.e. it's
  XMLRUNTIMEATT (and LPXMLRUNTIMEATT) etc.
  
- LPVECTOR type has changed to LPXMLVECTOR and all
  names of vector routines now have prefix XML i.e. it's XMLVector_Append
  instead of Vector_Append.
  
- Most XMLCH* parameters to callbacks have been changed to const XMLCH*

- Whitespace property removed. Attribute whitespace can be controlled
  with XMLFlags now. Whitespace in element content can be normalized
  with XMLNormalizeBuf helper function.

- Member encoding of LPXMLPARSER struct has been removed. XML declaration
  is now reported through xmlDeclHandler.
  
- Member features of LPXMLPARSER struct has been removed. Features are
  now handled by XMLFlags. See manual.

- XML_DTD_HANDLER event type has been removed. There's startDTDHandler
  and endDTDHandler instead.
  
- Many event type names have changed e.g. from XML_END_HANDLER to
  XML_END_ELEMENT_HANDLER. I guess this won't affect many existing apps.
