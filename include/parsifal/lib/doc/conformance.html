<h2 style="margin-left: 0px;">OASIS XML testsuite results for Parsifal XML Parser</h2>
<br>
<p>
<a href="xmlconf_results.html">Here</a> are the results of running <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/" target="_top">OASIS XML testsuite</a>.
  Results of some Parsifal specific tests and issues can be found <a href="parsifal_results.html">Here</a>.
</p>
<p>
XMLconf test results for validating mode are <a href="xmlconf_results_valid.html">here</a> and Parsifal specific
tests are <a href="parsifal_results_valid.html">here</a>. Note that validation support and testing is
currently work in progress although already <b>very stable</b> and all tests are passed
w/o any memory leaks.
</p>
<br>
<p>Tests prove several things about the parser:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very loyal to XML specification and to well-formedness rules - though not yet perfect (surprise!)</li>
<li>It passes testsuite without any memory leaks - it is essential for parser to handle erroneous conditions gracefully. There's also extra stress test because tests reuse the same parser.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>
There are some things you should consider when checking the results though:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes "red results" just indicate EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR, for example when test document uses name containing ':' char (that is XML namespaces 1.0 prefix separator)</li>
<li>Some ERROR results are reported as success "green FAIL results" but for wrong reason for example: ibm-not-wf-P13-ibm13n01.xml is reported green but since parsifal doesn't fully test publicID legal chars - error isn't catched - parsing fails in second error which is using DTD file as an entity.</li>
<li>Tests of type INVALID must be passed valid by non-validating parser.</li>
<li>Japanese (e.g. euc-jp) encoded test files report success because test parser uses libiconv!</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>New:</b> XMLDiff diffgram is generated when test output differs. There is <b>diff</b> link to diffgram file following 
output links.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>

Samples directory contains XMLTEST project with README which describes details on running the testsuite or any tests in XMLCONF format.
